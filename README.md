# Challenge-2

## Description

This is the second challenge assignment due on 11/3/22.

## Usage

The develop index.html code was created in order to provide myself with portfolio page to showcase the projects we will be creating throughout the bootcamp. Since there are 3 major projects, I have made 3 placeholder link boxes that will bring a hiring manager or recruiter to the projects.

I have styled the page to match the formatting and design of the landing page I created during the week 1 mini project.

I have tried multiple ways of linking the screenshots as required, using multiple different types of syntax including the syntax provided but I keep getting error code 404 when I try to open them up. The screenshots are located in the images folder, but I cannot get them to actually post in here too.
